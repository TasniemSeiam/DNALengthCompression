# DNA length Compression
Compressing DNA sequencing to reduce the physical storage used to save a large amount of genomic data, 
This project compressed the length of DNA sequence in fastaq file , by looping DNA bases , Counts the number of times a character is repeated and printed after the character




# To use it 
Download the fastq file you want to use as input( in this repository you can find "sample.fastq" file )
Download this repository 
Run compressed.py
